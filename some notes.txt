Hello!, if just have been encountering this error lately in
my code. When my then statement tries to access the promise

channel.join()
          .then((connection) => {...

i get this error:
FFMPEG was not found on your system, so audio cannot be played.
Please make sure FFMPEG is installed and in your PATH.

is this the module to help combat this?
npm install discord.js-arbitrary-ffmpeg --save
if so, is there documentation how to use it properly?

Nope, its this
npm i -g ffmpeg-binaries
